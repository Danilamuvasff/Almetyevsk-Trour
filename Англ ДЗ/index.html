        <img src="каскад прудов.jpg" alt="Каскад прудов">
        <p>A single water-architectural complex with a comfortable walking area. It is located in the central part of the city, on Beloglazova St., on the site between the central mosque on Marjani St. and the bath complex, between Beloglazova, Neftyanikov, Gafiatullin streets.</p>
        <p>The first stage of the cascade of ponds was inaugurated on August 27, 2003. The swampy ravine that ran between the city lake and Lenin Street turned into a clean, level pond with well-equipped shores, pedestrian paths, greenery, and lighting. The highlight was the delicate bridge, popularly called the "Bridge of Lovers."</p>
        <p>In 2013, the seventh stage of the cascade of ponds was inaugurated, completing a single water-architectural complex. In the same year, Cascade Ponds received the State Prize of the Republic of Tatarstan in the field of science and technology for the creation of unique memorial and cultural facilities in Almetyevsk.</p>
        <p>Today, there are small ponds with bridges in the center of the park. Nearby is Tatarstan's largest playground with an area of 5,000 square meters. According to the idea of the designers, the public space is divided into zones, each of which is associated with one of the elements: earth, air, water.

            There are swans and ducks swimming in the pond, which can be fed. In the evening, the park is beautifully illuminated, which makes it an ideal place for walking.</p>

            <p>The layout of the square is subordinated to the main directions of pedestrian movement and is centered around the sculpture "Karakuz" by Dasha Namdakov. Behind the sculpture is a "forest area" with an eco-trail that leads from the office and administrative complex to the square in front of the Almet Community Center, designed for urban events.</p>
